## Inspiration

As I have been focusing on ReactJS on SPA, I am exposing myself to React Native Expo in developing mobile application. Hence, Udemy being my first exposure to devleoping mobile application.

## Set up

### Dependencies

1. cd into the root directory
2. Run `npm install`

## Scripts

### Development

```
npm start
```

And you will be able to scan the QR code to run on your mobile `Expo Go` or alternatively run on your local simulator

### Linting and Testing

`NO TEST INCLUDED - HOPE TO DO IT IN THE NEAR FUTURE`

For unit testing, we will try to have an overall target of 80%

```
npm run lint
npm run test
```
